# Welcome to My **Totally Professional** Social Media Site™ 

## Brace Yourself for a Journey Through the Wild West of Web Development 🌵

This project is a **social media site** where nothing works quite as you'd expect. But hey, who needs *best practices* when you can have fun, right?

### A Glimpse Into the Madness:  
- **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and PHP** all coexisting *on the same page*. Because separating files is for the weak. 💪
- The **"Like"** and **"Unlike"** buttons are powered by good old integers. No boolean nonsense here just if/else end still working like a legend. Who need to good database structure? Im not. 🔥
- **Global chat** feature! 🎉 You can send messages for everyone to see... forever. Once you send it, it's there for life. **No one** (not even you) can delete it. So make sure to really think through those typos! 📝
- I even added a **chat feature**. It’s great, except for one small detail... *you can’t see the message you just sent*. But hey, it’s the thought that counts, right? 🙃
- **Post your own content**. Yes, I gave the power to post too! Because this must be a social media platform. 📝
  
### The **Legendary** Admin Panel 🛠️:  
My pride and joy: a feature-rich admin panel that looks like it could handle the backend of NASA but in reality… well, let's just say it's got a *unique* charm.

Here's what the admin panel *claims* to do:  
- **Ban** and **Unban** users at your whim. Give them a time-out or bring them back into the chaos. 🔨
- **Change user roles**. You want to make everyone an admin? Go for it! (Maybe not the best idea though.) 👑
- **Delete users** entirely. Be the judge, jury, and executioner of the userbase. 🗑️
- **View logs** Just feel like a hacker on the log screen and think about why we need this. 📜
- **Delete posts**. Cleaning up the mess users make one post at a time... or just because you feel like it. 🚮
- **Add explores** to keep everyone informed, though honestly, the real news is figuring out how this project still works. 📰

### What Else Can You Expect? 💬:
- The **follow** and **unfollow** features... work. But in a way that might make you question if they’re following or unfollowing you. It’s mysterious like that. 🤔
- If you like surprises, you’ll love clicking around and discovering which parts of the site behave in ways that were definitely not intentional but are definitely entertaining. 🎢

### How to Experience the Wonder:
1. **Run it.** If it breaks, don't panic. It was probably supposed to do that. 🤷
2. **Click around.** Expect nothing, be surprised by everything.
3. **Enjoy** the thrill of discovering a feature, only for it to behave in ways you didn’t know were possible. (This is what I call "user engagement.") ✨

### Fun Bugs You Might Encounter 🐛:
- Want to have a **conversation with yourself**? The chat feature is perfect! Because you won’t see your own messages. Who needs replies when you’ve got *mystery*? 🔍
- The admin panel **looks** impressive but sometimes... well, let’s just say its true power is in making you feel like you’re in control. 🤡

### A interesting page "World" 🌎: 
- This i a red button just dont click.

### Final Words of Wisdom 🧠:
This project is a reflection of my journey into the wonderful, tangled world of PHP and web development. It might be messy, it might not work perfectly (or at all), but at least it’s **mine**. 😅

Good luck! You’ll need it. 🎢
